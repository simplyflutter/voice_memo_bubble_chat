# Voice Memo Bubble Chat - Flutter Project

Welcome to the repository for our Voice Memo Bubble Chat Flutter Project!

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to build a voice memo bubble chat interface using Flutter. The application includes a custom audio player, with features such as play, pause, and scrubbing through an audio file. 

We've used various packages like:
- `just_audio` for audio processing,

The goal is to show how one can create complex, interactive user interfaces with Flutter.
